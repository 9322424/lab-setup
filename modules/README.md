puppet automation code for windows package installation using chocolatey

It requires chocolatey should be prior install on remote host using chocolatey forge module/mannulay/or else
####Error
1. in my case i face problem to install packages on windows even if i installed chocolatey it said class not found as i include chocolatey modules.
2. or when i skip include module chocolatey then it works but no package installed on machine i just run script without giving error.
